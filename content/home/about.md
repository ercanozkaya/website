I am a software engineer based in Istanbul, Turkey. 

My main focus is crafting products with a robust architecture that provide a natural user experience.

I am passionate about free software and have worked on various [open source projects](https://github.com/ercanozkaya) throughout my career. Most notable is the [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/) project where I took the role of release manager and also participated in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program.

Right now I work as a consultant for [Timble](https://www.timble.net/) where I lead the [Joomlatools](https://joomlatools.com/) brand and build things for the web.
